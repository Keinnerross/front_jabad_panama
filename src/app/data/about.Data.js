    descriptionLong: `Nestled in the serene mountain town of Boquete, Chabad warmly welcomes every Jew — whether you're here to explore the breathtaking landscapes, to work remotely in peace, or simply passing through. We are a home away from home, a vibrant and inclusive center for Jewish life, learning, and connection.

At Chabad of Boquete, our mission is to serve the spiritual and practical needs of every Jew, regardless of background, level of observance, or prior affiliation. We believe that every Jew is part of one family, and we strive to create a space that reflects that — where no one feels like a stranger, and everyone is treated with care and respect.

We host Shabbat meals, Torah classes, holiday events, and offer personal guidance, ensuring that Jewish life in Boquete remains active, meaningful, and accessible. Our community is made stronger through acts of kindness, mitzvot, and learning, and we're honored to be a part of your journey, wherever it may lead.

This center exists because of people like you — travelers, locals, seekers, and friends — coming together in shared identity and purpose. Whether you're lighting candles with us on a Friday night or stopping in for a coffee and a chat, know that you’re not just welcome here — you belong here.
